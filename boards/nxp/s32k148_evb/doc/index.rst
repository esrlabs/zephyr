Overview
********

`NXP S32K148-Q176`_ is a low-cost evaluation and development board for general-purpose industrial
and automotive applications.
The S32K148-Q176 is based on the 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4F `NXP S32K148`_ microcontroller.

The default configuration can be found in the Kconfig file
:zephyr_file:`boards/nxp/s32k148_evb/s32k148_evb_defconfig`.

.. note::
   Before using the Ethernet interface, please take note of the following:
   - For boards with the part number ``LSF24D`` at ``U16``, ``R553`` needs to be depopulated.

Connections and IOs
===================

This board has 5 GPIO ports named from ``gpioa`` to ``gpioe``.

Pin control can be further configured from your application overlay by adding
children nodes with the desired pinmux configuration to the singleton node
``pinctrl``. Supported properties are described in
:zephyr_file:`dts/bindings/pinctrl/nxp,port-pinctrl.yaml`.

LEDs
----

The NXP S32K148-Q176 board has one user RGB LED that can be used either as a GPIO
LED or as a PWM LED.

.. table:: RGB LED as GPIO LED
   :widths: auto

   ===============  ================  ===============  =====
   Devicetree node  Devicetree alias  Label            Pin

   led1_blue_pwm    pwm-led2 / blue-pwm-led   LED1_RGB_BLUE_PWM   PTE23 / FTM4_CH3
   ===============  ========================  ==================  ================

The user can control the LEDs in any way. An output of ``0`` illuminates the LED.

Buttons
-------

The NXP S32K148-Q176 board has two user buttons:

+-----------------+-------+-------+
| Devicetree node | Label | Pin   |
+=================+=======+=======+
| sw0 / button_3  | SW3   | PTC12 |
+-----------------+-------+-------+
| sw1 / button_4  | SW4   | PTC13 |

Serial Console
==============

The serial console is provided via ``lpuart1`` on the OpenSDA adapter.

+------+--------------+
| Pin  | Pin Function |
+======+==============+
| PTC7 | LPUART1_TX   |
+------+--------------+
| PTC6 | LPUART1_RX   |
+------+--------------+

System Clock
============

The Arm Cortex-M4F core is configured to run at 80 MHz (RUN mode).

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``s32k148_evb`` board can be built in the usual way as
documented in :ref:`build_an_application`.

Configuring a Debug adapter
===========================

This board integrates an OpenSDA debug adapter. It can be used for flashing and debugging.
The board cannot be debugged using the ``west debug`` command, since pyOCD does not support the target.

Connect the USB cable to a PC and connect micro USB connector of the USB cable to micro-B port J24 on the ``s32k148_evb``.

Install the debug host tools as in indicated in :ref:`nxp-s32-debug-host-tools`.

In order to use GDB, first install PEMicro USB driver:

- download `PEMicro USB driver`_
- Windows: run installation file, Linux: extract downloaded file and run ``setup.sh`` file

Next, download GDB Server Plug-In. It provides GDB remote debugging and flash programming support:

- download `GDB Server Plug-In for Eclipse-based ARM IDEs`_
- extract downloaded file
- unzip jar file ``com.pemicro.debug.gdbjtag.pne_X.X.X.XXXXXXXXXXXX.jar``

The server can be run using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

	pegdbserver_console -startserver -device=NXP_S32K1xx_S32K148F2M0M11

Use this command to flash ``zephyr.elf`` file:

.. code-block:: console

	(gdb) load zephyr.elf

Configuring a Console
=====================

We will use OpenSDA as a USB-to-serial adapter for the serial console.

Use the following settings with your serial terminal of choice (minicom, putty, etc.):

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1
